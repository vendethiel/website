Hello there, I'm **Mathieu Gall√©-Tessonneau**, a young french developer, passionate about development and japanese popular culture.

## Job
I work at Caplogik, mainly doing web development with PHP (Symfony). I'm also a JavaScript (and his preprocessors) user, it's actually the language with which I'm most comfortable. It already happened to me to use Java, Haskell, Perl6 and Ruby but I'm not experienced enough with them.

## Hobbies
I spend most of my free time between developing almost functionnal things, making stunning cosplay stuff, and watching animes.
